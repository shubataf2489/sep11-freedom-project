I have decided to create a flying obstacle game using A-Frame. To experiment with my tool, I undertook various tasks.

Firstly, I cloned the A-Blast project https://github.com/aframevr/a-blast and attempted to create different levels, implement a scoring system, and reduce the difficulty. One skill I honed during tinkering is debugging, where I had to identify the bug causing my code to stop working. Additionally, I aimed to change the background during level transitions, but I faced challenges in identifying the relevant code for the background. After a few mistakes, I eventually located the code responsible for the background.I also tried to implement a scoring system, but it didn't function as expected. I struggled with figuring out how to add a score without interfering with other parts of the code. This hindered my ability to make the background change when the player advanced to the next level, as I intended for the level transition to occur after the player successfully shot down 5 of the sprites. When  I cloned the A-Blast project https://github.com/aframevr/a-blast, I faced so many difficulties and the more I tried to unveil each topic the more it felt as if I was going down a rabbit hole. There was more than 20 directories


While tinkering with my tool, I reconsidered the shooting game idea and decided to create a game where a plane flies in the air. Using the up, down, left, and right arrows, I can control the airplane. I added obstacles to make the game challenging. Referring to the YouTube video https://youtu.be/cS8uGfd_oG8?si=ei0Qw-JAGN4aTQAm, I learned how to create a setting for my aircraft. I incorporated a blue sky, some clouds, and a bird, although the bird looks very 2D.Another skill I developed during tinkering is organization. When I cloned A-Blast, I had many files in my IDE, and I organized them by moving them into a separate folder outside of my JS to avoid confusion.
