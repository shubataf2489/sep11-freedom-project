### Context/Engineering design process


The engineering design process I’m in right now is communicating your results with my partner. We are both testing and preventing our projects. Right now we are discussing what went well and what we should have worked on in our project. Being confident in your work was the biggest thing I learned. I also learned that the only way you can be confident about your work is when you fully understand it, plus a little acting. While presenting, there were a couple of times I improvised and changed what I was going to say. I kept focusing on my weak points, such as eye contact and speaking loudly enough. I was confident that I would be able to explain well enough, so I didn’t focus on that aspect. Another thing that helped ease my nerves was knowing my classmates, and in a couple of minutes, this presentation would be irrelevant.

During the expo, I had to change my elevator pitch based on my audience. For example, when presenting in front of three judges, twelve/eleventh graders, and some sophomores, I adjusted my approach. I would implement some friendly jokes to keep my peers' attention or shorten the part of my speech where I explained my challenges. I also realized that when working with other people on a project, communicate every step you do with them. Also leave extra time for any unforeseen challenges.

## Activities:

- **In-class presentation:** We practiced our presentation skills, focusing on clarity, controlling our taking pace, and confidence.

- **Review of how to present:** Learning the key components of presenting a good presentation.
- **Expo:** Presenting to  judges and many people, gaining valuable real-world experience.

### Takeaway:

One of the key components I learned about presenting is keeping a steady speaking pace. Improvisation can also improve your presentation because things can turn out better than you expect if you are flexible. Additionally, I learned the importance of being prepared to pick up the slack if team members are having difficulties.

### Next Steps:

Moving forward, I plan to continue learning from my mistakes and always leave extra time for unforeseen challenges. This approach will help ensure that I am well-prepared and confident in future presentations, allowing me to deliver my best performance every time. 

The expo provided invaluable insights of presenting. Confidence, adaptability, and thorough preparation are key to successful presentations. By applying these lessons, I aim to improve continually and excel in future projects and presentations.
### Skills:
Time management: We both followed a strict schedule and both worked on our project at different times when we couldn't work together and when we could we would share  our discoveries.
Communication: I had to communicate and collaborate and share my findings with my partner on many occasions to ensure we were on the same page. Every weekend my partner and I call each other and share our screen every time we code to show each other what we are doing. Calling each other makes us accountable to do the work.
