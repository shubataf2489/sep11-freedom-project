# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Shubata Fizin

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to  study Aframe in order to help me make a shooting game.


My Freedom Project’s main goal is to create a decompression game. We designed an interesting city with a unique landscape for people to explore. Additionally, we developed a shooting game where players can take out their frustration by shooting targets. Unfortunately, we faced complications with adding music to make the game more relaxing, so it had to be removed.

### Summary of why we created the project:

My partner and I are using A-Frame to make a 3D simulation of a game. We want to create a shooting game that can help release pent-up stress from school, work, and other sources. Our goal is to make a game that is both interesting and relaxing. It may sound ironic that a shooting game can be relaxing, but releasing frustration and stress through gameplay is possible. According to the article "How Do Video Games Reduce Stress?", we are using existing games made with A-Frame for inspiration to create our own game. Our game will feature 360-degree images where players can move and interact with objects like cars, airplanes, and guns.

### Summary of the project:

Our game is called "The Quiet City," where you and your thoughts can freely escape reality. Our game has multiple uses. You can shoot the target to take out your frustration. After 6 minutes, when the targets disappear, you can explore the city and find our mascot! I hope our game helps you de-stress! One of the problems we faced was creating the shooting component. It was hard for us to code a way to shoot the targets and make them disappear. We couldn’t figure it out until we read many documents/tutorials and spent a lot of time coding on jsbin. Another difficulty was creating the environment, as it was very time-consuming to design each building and position them.

### Summary of presentation:

Confidence in your work is crucial, and thorough understanding builds that confidence. During the presentation, focusing on weak points like eye contact and volume is essential, and improvisation can be beneficial. At the expo, I adjusted my elevator pitch based on the audience, incorporating friendly jokes or shortening explanations as needed. I also learned the importance of being prepared to handle additional work when team members fall short. Key components of a good presentation include maintaining a steady pace and being flexible. Moving forward, I will continue to learn from my mistakes and allocate extra time for unforeseen challenges to ensure confidence and preparedness in future presentations.

### Global Impact

- **Governments/Laws:**
  - Helping people de-stress can potentially reduce crime rates.
  - Can increase gun violence (although we would put a warning in the game before making it public).

- **Environment:**
  - The dystopian storyline of our game can inspire people to take better care of our planet to prevent such a future.

- **Social Impact:**
  - *Individuals:* The game can help people relax and take their minds off things.
  - *Relationships:* It can also help people create memorable experiences together.

- **Economic Impact:**
  - This game is free to play and does not have direct economic impacts unless players are charged to play.

# Timeline

# HSTAT SEP | SEP11
# Freedom Project MVP Plan
## Name(s): Shubata Fizin, Shelly Weng

# Timeline:
This document is due F 2/16
Your actual MVP is due W 5/1
M = minimum. It’s not much. You probably have lots of ideas to improve it.
V = viable. It works. It functions. No bugs.
P = product. You made it. Be proud!


Directions: Use this document to help you plan your MVP by answering the questions below.

### Tool: Aframe
### Product: A shooter game that is entertaining and stress reducing to play.
### Example: a web application that turns the verbal Green Glass Door riddle into a digital version.
