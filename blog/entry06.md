### Context/Engineering Design Process

The engineering design process I'm currently engaged in involves communicating our results with my partner. We are both testing and refining our projects. Currently, we are discussing what went well and what we should have worked on in our project. The biggest thing I learned is the importance of being confident in your work. I also learned that confidence comes from fully understanding your work and a bit of acting. During the presentation, I improvised and changed what I was going to say a couple of times. I focused on improving my weak points, such as eye contact and speaking loudly enough. I was confident that I could explain well, so I didn't worry too much about that aspect. Another thing that helped ease my nerves was knowing my classmates and realizing that in a few minutes, this presentation would be over.

During the expo, I had to adjust my elevator pitch based on my audience. For instance, when presenting to judges, eleventh graders, and some sophomores, I adapted my approach. I would incorporate friendly jokes to maintain my peers' attention or shorten the part of my speech where I explained my challenges. I also realized the importance of communicating every step of the project when working with others and leaving extra time for any unforeseen challenges.

## Activities:

- **In-class presentation:** Practicing presentation skills, focusing on clarity, controlling speaking pace, and confidence.
- **Review of how to present:** Learning the key components of delivering a good presentation.
- **Expo:** Presenting to judges and a large audience, gaining valuable real-world experience.

### Takeaway:

One of the key components I learned about presenting is maintaining a steady speaking pace. Improvisation can also enhance your presentation, as things can turn out better than expected if you are flexible. Additionally, I learned the importance of being prepared to step in if team members are facing difficulties.

### Next Steps:

Moving forward, I plan to continue learning from my mistakes and always leave extra time for unforeseen challenges. This approach will help ensure that I am well-prepared and confident in future presentations, allowing me to deliver my best performance every time.

The expo provided invaluable insights into presenting. Confidence, adaptability, and thorough preparation are key to successful presentations. By applying these lessons, I aim to continually improve and excel in future projects and presentations.

### Skills:
- **Time Management:** We both followed a strict schedule and worked on our project at different times when we couldn't work together. When we could work together, we would share our findings.
- **Communication:** I had to communicate and collaborate and share my findings with my partner on many occasions to ensure we were on the same page. Every weekend, my partner and I call each other and share our screens when we code to show each other what we are doing. Calling each other makes us accountable to do the work.
