* I cloned theA -Frame (A-Blast) project and attempted to create different levels, a scoring system, and reduce the difficulty. I also aimed to change the background when the levels increases, but I found  identify the code for the background. After a few mistakes, I eventually located the code responsible for the background. Next I tried to makes a scoring system, but it didn't function as expected. I had difficulty figuring out how to add a score without the other parts of the code failing. Thus I couldn't  make the background change when the player went to the next  level, as I intended for the level transition to occur after the player successfully shot down 5 of the sprites.
